### Business Requirements

To achieve this, it is necessary to maintain records of job seekers and employer details.

### Licensing

According to me an Open-Source Project, the MIT License is one of the most permissive and popular open-source licenses. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, like making and distributing copies, or making changes and improvements, as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable for any issues.

Here's why the MIT License could be a good choice:

Permissiveness: The MIT License is a permissive license. This means it allows users to do whatever they want with the software (such as use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software), provided that the original copyright notice and the permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Simplicity and Permissiveness: The MIT License is brief and straightforward, making it easy for other developers to understand. It allows your work to be used in almost any context, which includes commercial and proprietary uses.

Popularity: The MIT License is widely used in the open-source community. This makes it familiar and trusted, which can encourage more use and contributions.

Compatibility: The MIT License is compatible with many other licenses, including the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means that your code can be combined with code under those licenses without legal issues.

No Warranty: The license explicitly states that the software is provided "as is," without any warranty of any kind.

No Liability: The license includes a disclaimer stating that the authors or copyright holders will not be liable for any damages arising from the software.

The initial approach to this project involves the following steps:

1. Job seekers and employers will be asked to fill out Google Forms.
2. The information will be extracted in .CSV format and loaded into the database.
3. A framework will be created to access the database data, which includes:
   - Connection to the database
   - Loading data
   - Retrieving data
   - Mapping job seekers to appropriate job positions
4. The mapped data will be available on the front end, either by sorting based on employer details or job positions.
