# APACHE LICENSE
I would suggest Apache License because it is a permissive open-source software license that grants users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute software.
It is classified as a permissive license because it imposes minimal restrictions on the use and distribution of the licensed software.
It aligns with the principles of the open-source movement, promoting collaboration, transparency, and the sharing of software code.
The majority of Apache projects and modern open-source software are licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0.
It includes a patent grant clause, which provides protection against potential patent claims related to the licensed software.
