The Transformative Workforce Academy's main goal is to promote diversity and inclusivity among participants by inviting 
people from all backgrounds. We pledge to uphold a welcoming environment that is warm and secure for everyone, regardless 
of gender, sexual orientation, ability, race, socioeconomic background, or religious convictions.

We encourage you to notify the project team right away if you ever come up against an unfounded allegation that you 
violated this Code of Conduct. Give us a brief explanation of your issue, and we'll respond in accordance with our established 
regulatory procedures.

Positive criticism is highly regarded. We encourage you to provide constructive criticism when doing so, since this promotes 
the development and improvement of the community.
The most important thing is to help and direct new members. It is crucial to offer support and encouragement because every 
member of the community was once a newcomer looking for guidance.
All community members, including contributors (regardless of payment), sponsors, visitors, and others, are expected to 
follow the following Rules of Responsibility in all public and private areas of the community, whether they are virtual or 
actual venues.

Consider including inside information when writing complex code portions.
User Guide Improvements: Be sure to update the user guide if your changes have an impact on how users interact with it.
Attend Meetings: Attend regular community meetings to stay informed and share your thoughts.
Reflect on mentoring new contributors before offering mentoring. Sharing your knowledge helps build and strengthen 
communities.
Address Review Feedback: As soon as you receive comments on your pull request, respond right away to make any necessary 
adjustments.
Examine the pull requests of your peers to gain new insights and to better your understanding of the project.
Remember that the collaborative process doesn't end when you submit a pull request. Be receptive to criticism as it is 
an essential component of the improvement process. In the same way, looking at other people's pull requests gives you a 
chance to learn more about the project and offer insightful feedback in addition to looking for faults.
Credit Others: Give appropriate credit when using someone else's code or idea.
Celebrate Success: Highlight accomplishments like the merging of your pull request or eminent contributions.

To avoid potential merge conflicts, keep your fork constantly synced with the main repository. 
And last, maintaining your fork's consistency with the main repository makes collaboration easier. 
Conflicts can be avoided and a smooth workflow can be maintained with regular upgrades.
